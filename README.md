# personal_projects
These are a few code snippets I've done that I'm proud of posting

These are a few projects I've done along the way. They are by far big or polished, but they are what I'm currently interested in and show off a little of what I can do.

## hacking

Everything in this directory is linked to some of my scripts I've done to solve some CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges.

## gaming

These are some personal games and library demos that I've worked on, when I've been learning how to use the `curses` and `pygame` modules for Python.
